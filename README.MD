I will be using reinforcement learning to teach the machine how to play

eg.deepmind learning and deepQ learning is made with these concepts


we will mainly be using the copy() and mutate() functions from the Toy Neural Network Library

most of the generic algorithms will be placed in neuro -> ga.js
